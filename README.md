# 📚 DSA School Activities Repository

Welcome to my DSA repository
This is a collection of my school activities, assignments, and projects related to data structures and algorithms. It's meant to serve as both a personal archive and a showcase of my progress and understanding over time.

## 📂 Contents

- ✅ Problem-solving exercises  
- 🧠 Algorithm implementations  
- 🗃️ Classic data structure examples  


## 🛠️ Topics might be Covered in  the meanwhile

- Arrays and Strings  
- Linked Lists  
- Stacks and Queues  
- Trees and Graphs  
- Sorting and Searching  
- Recursion and Backtracking  
- Dynamic Programming  
- Greedy Algorithms  
- Hashing and Heaps  

## 🚀 How to Use

Feel free to explore the folders and files! Each activity is stored in its own directory with code, input/output examples, and sometimes a short explanation or readme.

## 🎯 Goal

To deepen my understanding of fundamental programming concepts and prepare for future technical interviews, exams, and real-world problem-solving.
